# PowershellTools
Tools I have found useful, in PS1

## Overview

This PowerShell script uses `System.IO.FileSystemWatcher` to **monitor a log file in real time**. When new lines are written to the file, it evaluates them for specific patterns (e.g., `"ERROR"` or `"SUCCESS"`) and can trigger custom actions such as alerting or logging.

Designed for automation pipelines, deployments, or long-running applications that write logs during execution.

---

## âœ… Features

- Watches a specified `.log` file for live updates
- Detects and responds to `"ERROR"` or `"SUCCESS"` entries
- Runs continuously in the console
- Easy to extend with email alerts, Splunk integration, or Event Log entries

---

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Edit the top section of the script to specify the log file to watch:

```powershell
$logFilePath = "C:\Logs\deployment.log"
```
